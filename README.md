# My-Blog
This is my first Blog.
It has some of the blog written by me. Sorry, but all of blogs contains wague content.
All the blogs have Tags attached with them so hat all the posts can be searched having similar tags.
It also contains the details like when that particular post was posted, the time, the date and the person who posted that post.

I have included pagination in my website so that only a particular no. of posts can be seen on one page. 
You can click on "next" or "previous" to move from one page to next or previous one.

When you click any post a page will open depicting the content of that post.
Also you can see the similar posts and moreover you can commment on that post.
All you have to do is write your name, your Email-Id, And body of the comment and finally click on "Add comment".

One of the best feature it got is that you can share the post through Email.

On the right, there is a sidebar that shows how many posts I have writren so far, what are lastest posts and what are most commented posts.
